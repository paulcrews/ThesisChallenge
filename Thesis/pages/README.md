THESIS CODING CHALLENGE


- I used HTML/CSS for this task. Didn't find much need for JavaScript though.
- The only design flaw I noticed was in the form. The caption below the form reads "By clicking "Sign Up" I aggree to our Terms of Service." Should it read "By clicking 'Sign up' [you] aggree to our Terms of Service". Or "By clicking 'Sign up' I agree to [your] Terms of Services."
- I was able to get the task done using VS Code. Because, I am using a MacBook to code, I am unable to test on Internet Explorer.
